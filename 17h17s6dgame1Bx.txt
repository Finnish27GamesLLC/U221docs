     and the column with the label corresponding to the point value assigned to the dealer up card
     to the cell containing data pertaining to this particular three card combination.

     Next look in this cell for the highest number that is less than or equal to the card count

     Execute the instruction indicated by the letter above this number to respond to the hand.

     If all numbers in the cell are greater than the card count,
     then execute the instruction that is at the bottom of the cell.
